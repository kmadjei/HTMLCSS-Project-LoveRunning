# HTML / CSS Walkthrough Project - Love Running
---
This is my first walkthrough project in which an imagined website (Love Running) is built for a local running community using HTML and CSS. The website is a fully responsive design showcasing the harmonious result between HTML5 and CSS3.

ðŸ‘‰ [Quick Preview](https://kmadjei.github.io/HTMLCSS-Project-LoveRunning/)
 
## UX
---
 
The website was designed for running enthusiasts looking to join in on regular runs happening in the community of _DUBLIN DOCKLANDS & PHOENIX PARK_. 

>> As a user of this website I would like to drop in and be able to connect with fellow runners, to keep consistent motivation for living a healthy lifestyle.


### Mockups
